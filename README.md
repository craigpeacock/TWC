# TWC
C Code to talk to the Tesla Wall Connector Gen2 (EVW2T32HL)

This is based on works from https://github.com/dracoventions/TWCManager and the Wall Connector load sharing protocol thread at https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/new-wall-connector-load-sharing-protocol.72830/

The above mentioned TWCManager is written in python and is not suitable for porting to microcontroller systems. My aim is to eventually port this code to the ESP32.

Currently the code runs on Linux (Tested on ubuntu 19.10) and the Raspberry PI.
